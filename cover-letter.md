Dear Editors,

We would like to submit our paper, entitled "The MIMIC Code Repository: enabling reproducibility in critical care", for publication in eLife. The paper describes a collection of software that we believe is both an important research contribution to accelerate progress in the field of secondary analysis of electronic health records, as well as a strategy to improve research reproducibility.

The MIT Laboratory for Computational Physiology has gained expertise in integrating and analyzing high-resolution electronic health records from critical care patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, USA over the past decade. A de-identified version is shared with thousands of researchers around the world as a database known as the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care or MIMIC database. Using MIMIC, researchers have discovered novel relationships between patient factors, treatments including medications and outcomes, and built decision support tools and treatment optimization algorithms for the intensive care unit.

There are challenges in secondary analysis of routinely collected health data, because the data is collected for care documentation and to support billing, and not specifically for research. Learning from the data is complex, requiring close collaboration with hospital staff including nurses, doctors, respiratory therapists and so on. Concepts must be defined; for example, the concept of mechanical ventilation or a breathing machine is an invasive treatment easily identified at the bedside, but in MIMIC it must be inferred from inspired oxygen settings documented by nursing staff. The same holds for dialysis, severity of illness, intravenous medication usage, and many more concepts key to clinical research. As a consequence of these challenges: (i) researchers struggle in discovering new insights, and (ii) definition of these concepts can differ from researcher to researcher.

In collaboration with clinicians, we have created open source software that defines a large number of key concepts to facilitate research on the MIMIC database. Developing these concepts required both technical and clinical expertise and are valuable to future observational studies. In addition, the tools will assist investigators in reproducing retrospective clinical research using electronic health records.

We believe this work will serve as a foundation for a large body of future work in supplementing prospective randomized controlled trials in generating evidence around individualized patient recommendations in the intensive care unit.

Kind Regards,

Alistair Johnson, on behalf of the authors
