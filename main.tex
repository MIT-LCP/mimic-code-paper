\textbf{Motivation:} Secondary analysis of electronic health records is an important method for gaining insight into clinical care. Retrospective studies frequently require similar clinical concepts, so there is benefit in providing open, standardized tools for deriving these concepts to ensure the consistency and efficiency of future studies.\\
\textbf{Results:} We present the MIMIC Code Repository, a collection of open source code for deriving clinical concepts using the MIMIC Critical Care Database. Concepts include severity of illness scores, organ failure indices, and duration of treatments such as ventilation and dialysis. \\
\textbf{Availability:} The MIMIC Code Repository is in active development on GitHub. All code is made available under a permissive MIT license unless otherwise indicated.\\

\section{Introduction}

There is substantial heterogeneity in intensive care populations, particularly in aspects such as patient physiology, presence of disease, and intervention types. This heterogeneity presents a significant challenge to understanding the relationships between provision of care and patient outcomes, and as a result the benefit of many widely-practiced treatments and interventions remains inconclusive [REFS: Ioannadis].

Vast quantities of data are routinely collected by modern hospital monitoring systems and even more so in intensive care units where patients frequently suffer organ failure and require close observation. There is optimism that increasing availability of large scale clinical databases will offer opportunities to overcome many of the challenges associated with heterogeneity and offer new insights into critical care medicine [REF: BIG DATA etc]. 

One such database is the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III), collected from patients admitted to intensive care units in the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA \cite{mimiciii}. The latest version of MIMIC-III, v1.3, houses data spanning 11 years between 2001 and 2012, and is made freely available to researchers upon signing of a data use agreement and proof of a human studies training course. 

MIMIC-III is an unmatched research resource in the area of critical care informatics that promotes crowdsourcing of knowledge generation and sharing of fully reproducible studies.
%[Briefly say here that in the past people have not shared their code systematically, which is bad. Leads on to next section.]
Analysis of critical care data often requires definition of clinical concepts, such as severity of illness scores, organ failure indices, and duration of treatments including ventilation and dialysis.
Historically, this code has been produced by independent researchers; a process which is time consuming, inefficient, and error-prone.
Furthermore, many decisions are made when extracting clinical concepts, and these decisions may have a large impact on the resultant analysis. One example is code written to extract the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Severity of illness scores stipulate a value of 15 (``normal'') should be assigned when the GCS cannot be obtained (e.g. due to patient sedation). However, it is common for clinical staff to record values of 3 for the GCS of sedated patients. This results in a systematic bias for sedated patients unless appropriate measures are taken to correct the recorded values. Even if correctly performed, these details would likely be omitted from publications, making study methods difficult to reproduce.

%Typically the code used to generate these concepts is generated by the researcher and often not widely shared for reuse or validation. The result is that work is not easily reviewed and reused, leading to inconsistent approaches between projects, repeated work, and increased probability of errors in the extraction process. 
There is a great opportunity for unifying studies on MIMIC with the creation of a centralized repository for data extraction code. Here we describe such a centralized repository, with the hope that is fulfills this need and enhances the reproducibility of research on the MIMIC-III database.

% Alistair: this is nice to say but feels a little redundant
%The MIMIC Code Repository helps to address these issues by providing a centralised and collaborative codebase for the research community. By allowing researchers to collaboratively develop, share, and review code, the repository helps to standardize the definition of key clinical concepts, promotes continuous review and improvement, and facilitates future studies on the MIMIC-III database.

\section{Results}


The code described herein follows guidelines for good practice in scientific programming, including incremental development with a distributed version control system, unit tests, and a public issue tracker [Ref: G Wilson paper].
A prerequisite for using much of the code in the MIMIC Code Repository is access to the MIMIC-III Database, so we provide scripts to enable researchers to build local copies of the MIMIC database in a variety of database systems including PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and MonetDB.
The set of core clinical concepts which have been extracted using structured query language (SQL)\footnote{All queries have been developed and tested using PostgreSQL 9.5.1.} are as follows: 

\emph{The Angus criteria for defining sepsis}: Sepsis is a serious illness caused by infection and is a major focus of clinical research. Angus criteria utilize billing codes to classify a hospital admission as being related to sepsis [REF TO ANGUS], and the criteria have been recently validated [RECENT ANGUS VALIDATION].

\emph{Severity of illness scores}: measures of illness are a useful tool for adjusting for patient severity when comparing patient populations. Scores implemented include the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), the Acute Physiology Score III (APS III), and the Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS) [REFS].

\emph{Organ failure scores}: Multi-organ failure is a hallmark of acute illness and quantify the morbidity for a given patient. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score [REF] and Logistic Organ Dysfunction System (LODS) [REF] both assess six organ systems for failure. Single organ failure scores implemented include MELD [REF], commonly used to determine suitability for a liver transplant, RIFLE [REF], which quantifies acute kidney injury, and KDIGO [REF], also used for acute kidney injury.

\emph{Comorbidity scores}: Critically ill patients frequently have many comorbidities which influence both their overall health and their individual stay. The Elixhauser Comorbidity Index summarizes the level of comorbidities in a patient using billing codes collected at hospital discharge [REFS].

\emph{Treatment durations}: Studying the effect of treatments on patient health is of great interest, though deriving the timing of these treatments from a database can be non-trivial. We provide views with (i) vasopressor use start and stop times for all vasopressors and individual medications and (ii) mechanical ventilation start and stop times. The duration of these interventions is also a useful measure of treatment intensity.

More detail on the extraction of these concepts is provided in the supplemental material.
An example of the importance of the variance caused by a non-centralized code base is shown in \ref{fig:SevScoresOverTime}, where the performances of two different implementations of the SOFA score in discriminating hospital mortality are shown. Both of these implementations have been used in previous publications.

%Additionally, we seek to provide introduction to the data. Tutorials are provided to give new users and introduction to the MIMIC database. A 'cookbook' of sample code is provided to introduce new users to the database in a friendly way. Ipython notebooks.

% Explain importance of the code. Why is it necessary. Who will use it? More detail about specific issue being addressed by the code. more detail about performance of the code.

% Studying the impact of treatment on patient health or adjusting for the use of treatment during a patient's care is a common task in secondary analysis of electronic health records. The MIMIC Code Repository provides start and stop times for mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and various vasopressors. An example of these durations is provided in Figure \ref{fig:treatment}.

% There are five severity of illness scores currently implemented in the MIMIC Code Repository: APS-III \cite{aps}, SAPS \cite{saps}, SAPS-II \cite{sapsii}, SOFA \cite{sofa} and OASIS \ref{oasis}. The performance of these scores in discriminating hospital mortality is shown in Figure \ref{fig:SevScoresOverTime}. More detailed comparison of the severity scores is provided in the supplementary material.

% In addition, scores used to measure the failure of a specific organ are also available for the hepatic (MELD \cite{meld}) and renal (KDIGO \cite{kdigo}, RIFLE \cite{rifle}) systems.

\section{Discussion}


% Discuss creating a reproducible workflow for research.

% Emphasise that the code will be reused widely in research studies. Also emphasise how much work has gone into creating the code. What are the challenges of creating the scores?

Numerous research studies have been carried out on the MIMIC database in the past, but the code used in analysis has largely been developed independently and often not shared. Lack of code sharing is typical of scientific software development and is a widely recognized issue [Ref: http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101013/full/467775a.html]. By creating the MIMIC Code Repository we have provided a central hub for development of clinical concepts, which we believe will help to standardize and improve future analyses.
The repository is intended to be a continuously developed resource enhancing the sustainability of the code and creating a community around data analysis in MIMIC.
%It is typical for PhD or Postdoctoral researchers to write code for a project without thought of long term usage, often leading to unmaintained and unusable code. The MIMIC Code Repository is intended to be a continuously developed resource. We anticipate its importance to grow over time, as the content increases. 

% Alistair: I think it's redundant to promote open code in a journal section dedicated to publishing open code.. kind of summarized the below statement above
%Openly available code is a key step in improving the quality of research as it provides validity to analyses performed and allows progressive improvement of code. While rare in clinical research, the combination of open data and code is powerful. Studies can be made reproducible and code is available to be reviewed and developed. Importantly, open resources such as MIMIC become important learning resources too: there are now multiple university courses around the world in which MIMIC forms a core learning tool. 



%\subsection{Collaboration}

% Conducting effective clinical research calls for a broad range of knowledge, covering areas such as clinical practice, data collection processes, and analytical methods. For this reason, we believe that it is important to nurture collaboration between disciplines including caregivers, computer scientists, and data analysts.

%A key challenge in developing the code within the repository is in understanding the nuances of the underlying hospital data, so the development process has involved close collaboration between hospital staff and data scientists. This cross disciplinary partnership is facilitated when code is shared openly and developed as a community. Mention how StackExchange is being used for discussion. Has this happened for other research projects? I guess so, but would be interesting to check.

%\subsection{Quality and sustainability}

%unit tests check the operation of software upon addition of new code to the repository, and a public issue tracker allows research related questions to be raised, encouraging community development and helping to ensure that the code is sustainable [Ref: G Wilson paper]. Often use Jupyter Notebook to create database connection to carry out studies. Continuous review. Services like Github provide incentives for researchers to contribute.

The MIMIC Code Repository is an important resource for researchers working with the MIMIC critical care database. The repository provides code for deriving a variety of clinical concepts and will continue to incorporate new concepts as they are calculated, allowing for rapid prototyping of clinical questions in a large retrospective database. 
Fully reproducible analytical workflow are encouraged by the openly available nature of both the data and code.
Finally, the code written is modular and generalisable, and may support research in other similarly structured clinical databases.
